Hi Marker,

You can find the files specified in the assignment in the folder '4files'.
4files folder includes:
    - partA.txt
    - server.js
    - posting.html
    - report.pdf

I figure it might be easier for you to mark with everything else set up.
So I include a docker-compose.yml file and a folder for the nodejs container
which has everything that's necessary to run the nodejs container. If you
run 'csh run.csh' in a terminal, you should be immediately directed to the
/bin/bash of the nodejs container, then you can just run 'node server.js'.
The same thing can be done with mysql container with 'csh rundb.csh'.

That's all! Have a great day! :))
